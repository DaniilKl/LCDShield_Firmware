# LCDShield_Firmware
<p>This repository consists of firmware I wrote for my LCD shield which is equipped with one LCD display and 6 buttons: 5 control buttons (wich are connected to pa0 pin on my nucleo-f401re) and one RESET button (connectoed to RESET pin). This shield has 4 data pin configuration for display, that it, the firmware is written and tested for 4 pin LCD communication mode (for details check documentation for your LCD). But, I have also implemented firmware for 8 pin LCD communication mode which is not tested , though. <\p>
<p> The repository also has main.c file that provide simple example with explicit ADC module initialization and configuration.<\p>
